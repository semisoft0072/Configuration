# Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Config

## Starting & Disclaimer
This autoexec contains Some of my personal settings, so be sure to change things like sensitivity and volume to your liking. I also recommend placing your external settings (Windows Sensitivity, DPI Resolution, etc.) The second part is custom commands and scripts you can't normally access via the in-game menus (like Tweaks & Other).

## autoexec.cfg
An autoexec.cfg, is a file any user can run in order to set the value of certain settings in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. This is useful for keeping your settings the same across multiple systems, or utilizing certain commands unavailable to you through the default in-game menus. The following is my custom configuration for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, having spent a considerable amount of time researching and compiling what I have found to be a solid foundation for an autoexec.

## video.txt
The video.txt file is optimized for the highest FPS performance and viability-feel free to modify it to your personal preferences.
