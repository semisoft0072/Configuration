# Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Config

Beginner players quite often face the problem when the CSGO config is repeatedly reset for inexplicable reasons when starting the game. In this case, setting up and using autoexec will be of great help to you.

## autoexec.cfg

An `autoexec.cfg` is basically a personal config file that you put in the game’s files with your own personal settings (such as crosshair settings, buy binds, sensitivy, and so on) so that the game automatically loads these settings each time you start up the game. That’s really handy in and of itself, but the cool thing is that this allows you to instantly load up your own settings anywhere.

## video.txt

The `video.txt` file is optimal settings for the best performance and best graphics.
